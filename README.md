# TonkahLUI
A LUI configuration by Tonkah

This is a LUI profile with profiles for Omen, Recount, Bartender, ArkInventory, TomTom, Chatter, DBM, and Healbot. It also contains other addons that don't require much configuration. I plan on adding, tweaking and improving these addons and profiles as I go, creating branches for various screen sizes.

All of these addons are available from their respective authors. This repo is for the simple purpose of saving you/me time in configuration, if you like the way my UI looks/works.

Master branch is 1920x1080 by default. Due to some addons not fully supporting profiles, some tweaking may be necessary after installing.
