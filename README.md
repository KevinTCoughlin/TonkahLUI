# TonkahLUI
A LUI configuration by Tonkah

This is a LUI profile with profiles for Omen, Recount, Bartender, Chatter, DBM, and Healbot. It also contains other addons that don't require much configuration. I plan on adding, tweaking and improving these addons and profiles as I go, creating branches for various screen sizes.

All of these addons are available from their respective authors. This repo is for the simple purpose of saving you/me time in configuration, if you like the way my UI looks/works.

Due to some addons not fully supporting profiles, some tweaking may be necessary after installing.

## Installation

1. Download source

1. Copy the `(Resolution)\Interface` folder to your `C:\World of Warcraft\` folder (Mac: `/Applications/World of Warcraft/`)
1. Copy the `(Resolution)\WTF` folder to your `C:\World of Warcraft\` folder (Mac: `/Applications/World of Warcraft/`) and rename the `SERVERNAME`, `ACCOUNTNAME` and `CHARACTERNAME` folders accordingly.

1. Tweak further as you see fit

## Contributors

Your installation instructions will be pretty much the same except that you'll want to fork/clone instead of just download. Once your git repo is set up, create symlinks to the desired WoW folders to easily track your changes.
