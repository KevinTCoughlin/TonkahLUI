# TonkahLUI
A LUI configuration by Tonkah

This is a LUI profile with profiles for Omen, Recount, Bartender, Chatter, DBM, and Healbot. It also contains other addons that don't require much configuration. I plan on adding, tweaking and improving these addons and profiles as I go, creating branches for various screen sizes.

All of these addons are available from their respective authors. This repo is for the simple purpose of saving you/me time in configuration, if you like the way my UI looks/works.

Due to some addons not fully supporting profiles, some tweaking may be necessary after installing.

## Installation

1. Copy the contents of the `[Screen-Resolution]\Interface` folder into your `C:\World of Warcraft\Interface` folder (Mac: `/Applications/World of Warcraft/Interface`).
1. Copy the contents of the `[Screen-Resolution]\WTF` folder into your `C:\World of Warcraft\WTF` folder (Mac: `/Applications/World of Warcraft/WTF`) and rename the `SERVERNAME`, `ACCOUNTNAME` and `CHARACTERNAME` folders accordingly.
1. Launch the Curse/Twitch client and update all addons to their latest version.
1. Launch WoW and configure each addon to use (or copy from) the `Taunkah LUI` profile.
1. Mess with your System Settings -> Interface Scale if you are getting items overlapping or not fitting.
1. Tweak further as you see fit.

## Contributors

Your installation instructions will be pretty much the same except that you'll want to fork/clone instead of just download. Once your git repo is set up, create symlinks to the desired WoW folders to easily track your changes.
